            Worked with Mabelle on a few common clients! She is a highly
            motivated, knowledgeable and responsible professional. Has great
            social networking skills, communication skills and will go out of
            her way to help clients with their needs! Highly recommend her to
            any of my clients!

            I have been working with Mabelle for over two years, and she has
            been very helpful in terms of academic and career advising. Studying
            with Mabelle, I have improved my writing skills significantly, and I
            have also established a clear academic and career goal. We worked
            together on my university applications, and I have now received
            acceptance letters from my dream universities. I really enjoy
            Mabelleâ€™s communication style, especially how she always guides me
            to the right answer instead of spoon-feeding it

            Mabelle is such a great advisor because she knows exactly what I
            need. Therefore, she can give me specific help to guide me to
            achieve my goal, and the result is always fulfilling. With her help,
            my English writing skills and reading skills improved a lot. She
            helped me to achieve my goal and got me into my dream school. In the
            three years learning with her, I felt that she can always give
            valuable suggestions for both academic and social skills. I really
            enjoyed the time that we worked together. I also learned a lot from
            her in order to become more mature in my life. I will always
            appreciate the time spent with her!
