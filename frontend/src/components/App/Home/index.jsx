              <p>I have been working with Mabelle for over two years, and she has been very helpful in terms of academic and career advising. Studying with Mabelle, I have improved my writing skills significantly, and I have also established a clear academic and career goal. We worked together on my university applications, and I have now received acceptance letters from my dream universities. I really enjoy Mabelleâ€™s communication style, especially how she always guides me to the right answer instead of spoon-feeding it</p>
